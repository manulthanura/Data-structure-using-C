# The Word Search Game

A word search engine is a website or application that allows users to find words in a grid of letters. The words can be hidden in any direction, including horizontally, vertically, diagonally, and backwards. Word search engines typically have a large database of words, and they allow users to search for words by letter, length, or theme.

## How I implement this?

I've crafted two fascinating algorithms, each employing distinct data structures, to power an engaging Word Search game. My noble pursuit revolves around unearthing the ultimate algorithm that can swiftly locate a word amidst a vast database of words. To achieve this goal, I've harnessed the prowess of both the Linear Search and Hash algorithms. While it's possible that superior algorithms exist, let's delve into the remarkable speed of my implementations and explore the wonders they unfold.

For this experiment, I used a database that includes more than 100,000 words. The database of words is available in the `database.txt` file.
